# Tabletop.Land - Headless Site

This is a repo for the headless Shopify vendor marketplace site [Tabletop.Land](https://tabletop.land), where we sell Tabletop Terrain, Miniatures, & accessories. It's built off of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/), & [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com). It doesn’t use anything fancy or complicated, for the most part.

The site is a multi-vendor marketplace, so anyone can become a vendor & sell their stuff! It’s owned by my wife & I, so come check it out!

## Is this an official Shopify repo?

Absolutely not. It is a side LLC I own & not at all affiliated with anything Shopify, other than running off Shopify.

## Why didn’t you use Liquid?

I did originally, but wanted more control over what I put on the screen, the pages people saw, & the size of the site as a whole.

I also wanted to be less tempted by 3rd party products to do the things I needed, because I feel like they sometimes over-complicate what I’m looking for.

## Then why didn’t you use Hydrogen?

I think [Hydrogen](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen) is a work of art, it’s seriously fantastic. It is just a little heavy handed for what I really need. For a larger store running it’s core business off Shopify & wanting a more headless experience, it’s perfect. If I had a team of developers, however large, & Tabletop.Land wasn’t a side gig where I wasn’t going to experiment or wanted a more solid foundation that is officially supported by Shopify, I would definitely choose Hydrogen.

## Is this repo meant for other developers or shops to use?

No. I just believe in open source & there isn’t anything proprietary that I need to hide. If other developers want to take a look at the code for inspiration or take chunks, then feel free. It is under the [MIT License](https://github.com/git/git-scm.com/blob/main/MIT-LICENSE.txt).
